# optparse
Command line option parser for C++

I didn't really like the command line option parsing libraries I found out there; they were either too bloated/complicated in terms of usage/installation or they didn't work quite how I would like it to, so I decided to make my own extremely simple header-only solution for use in my projects.

See `test.cpp` for an example of usage.
